# lexicon-rig
    
 "Lexicon Rig" is an exam preparation platform that 
    interacts with user and gives feedback on how well 
    he/she did on the quiz. 
    
   In this project, I have used classes, loops and if statements:
    Main functions in "module.py" with documentation and test of 
    the objects. It has "test_file.ipynb" where you can test 
    how the function works with sample questions. 
    Also, in this file("test_file.ipynb") has comments about 
    what are the roles of the functions. If you would like to 
    see the final result of the project and interact with 
    Lexicon-Rig checkout file called "quiz_is_here.ipynb"
