# lexicon-rig
    
 "Lexicon Rig" is an exam preparation platform that 
    interacts with user and gives feedback on how well 
    he/she did on the quiz. 
    
   In this project, I have used classes, loops and if statements:
    Main functions in "module.py" with documentation and test of 
    the objects. If you would like to see the final result of the 
    project and interact with Lexicon-Rig checkout file called "quiz_is_here.ipynb"
