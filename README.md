# lexicon-rig
    
 "Lexicon Rig" is an exam preparation platform that 
    interacts with user and gives feedback on how well 
    he/she did on the quiz. 
    
   In this project, I have used classes, loops and if statements:
    Main functions in "module.py" with documentation. It has "test_file.ipynb" 
    where you can test how the function works with sample 
    questions. Also, in this file("test_file.ipynb") 
    has comments about what are the roles of the functions. 
    If you would like to see the final result of the project 
    and interact with Lexicon-Rig checkout file called "quiz_is_here.ipynb"
    
    P.S. test_file.ipynb has some try outs I started originally 
    but decided to create new file. If you are interested you 
    can see what I have tried.
